🦠 Global Influenza Data Analysis & Visualization Dashboard (FluNet Project)

📖 Overview

This project analyzes and visualizes global influenza virus trends using the **WHO FluNet dataset (2018–2023)**.  
It combines **Python-based data analytics** and an **interactive Streamlit web app** to explore patterns, trends, and virus variants circulating worldwide.  

By leveraging libraries like **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Plotly**, **Altair**, **GeoPandas**, and **Streamlit**, this project transforms complex FluNet data into clear, interactive insights for researchers, health professionals, and the general public.  

🎯 Objectives

- Understand influenza virus spread patterns across years and continents  
- Identify major influenza **A and B subtypes** and their prevalence  
- Visualize **seasonal and geographical trends** using advanced data visualization  
- Build an **interactive Streamlit dashboard** for real-time data exploration

🧠 Project Goals

1. Utilize the most recent FluNet data for exploratory and time-series analysis  
2. Deliver effective data visualizations to reveal virus behavior and patterns  
3. Build an end-to-end analytical workflow — from cleaning to dashboard deployment
